COMMENT     The Escherichia coli whole genome shotgun (WGS) project has the
            project accession ABISVP000000000.  This version of the project
            (01) has the accession number ABISVP010000000, and consists of
            sequences ABISVP010000001-ABISVP010000201.
            The annotation was added by the assembly submitters using the NCBI
            Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP). Information about
            stand-alone PGAP can be found here: https://github.com/ncbi/pgap/
            This draft WGS assembly was generated by running SKESA to generate
            a de-novo assembly. The de-novo assembly was then concatenated with
            contigs generated using a guided assembler using antimicrobial
            resistance genes as baits to comprehensively catalog the set of
            resistance genes in the isolate. Note, some parts of the contigs
            derived from the guided assembler may overlap de-novo contigs, and
            other guided assembler contigs. De-novo contigs can be
            differentiated from guided assembler contigs by their names , which
            include either 'denovo' or 'guided'.
